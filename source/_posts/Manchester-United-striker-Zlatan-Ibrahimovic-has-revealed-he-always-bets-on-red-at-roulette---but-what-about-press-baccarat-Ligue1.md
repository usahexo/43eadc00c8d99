#  Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed he always bets on red at roulette - but what about press baccarat Ligue1?

It's no secret that Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic likes to take a gamble, with the Swede recently admitting he always bets on red at roulette. However, what about his casino game of choice - press baccarat?

Ibrahimovic has had a superb season in Ligue 1 with Paris Saint-Germain, with the 33-year-old scoring an impressive 38 goals in all competitions. However, it's his exploits away from the pitch which have caught the eye, with the former Barcelona and AC Milan striker revealing he always bets on red at roulette.

But what about press baccarat - does Ibrahimovic have any special tactics when playing the popular casino game?

Well, according to Ibra himself, he simply plays "a normal game", although he does enjoy mixing up his bets depending on the situation. For instance, if he has a good hand, Ibrahimovic will often place a large bet on the banker - but if he's feeling lucky, he'll also bet on himself too.

Interestingly, Ibrahimovic is not the only high-profile footballer to enjoy playing press baccarat - with Barcelona and Spain legend Lionel Messi also known to be a big fan of the game. In fact, Messi even has his own personal dealer who accompanies him to casinos across Europe whenever he wants to play.

So there you have it - Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Lionel Messi are both big fans of press baccarat! Who knew?

#  Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim backs youngster Kylian Mbappe to shine in Ligue1 this season - but can he handle the pressure of the casino?

Monaco manager Leonardo Jardim is backing up-and-coming youngster Kylian Mbappe to shine in France's top division this season - but can he handle the pressure of playing for one of the country's most prestigious teams?

The 18-year-old attacking midfielder has already made quite a name for himself, having impressed for Monaco last season during their successful run to the Champions League semi-finals. Mbappe is known for his blistering pace and clinical finishing, boasting an impressive strike rate despite his young age.

This season, Mbappe will have to shoulder even more of the goal-scoring burden following the departure of top scorer Radamel Falcao to newly promoted English Premier League side Aston Villa. And Jardim has no doubts that the youngster is capable of stepping up to the challenge.

"Kylian is a young player with great potential," Jardim told reporters at a recent press conference. "He showed last season that he can score goals at this level. He's worked hard over the summer and I'm confident he'll be able to reproduce his good form from last year."

Mbappe will no doubt be looking to impress new France national team head coach Didier Deschamps this season, with a place in Les Bleus' World Cup squad up for grabs. But with big clubs like Real Madrid and Barcelona reportedly interested in signing him, Monaco may find it difficult to hold on to their prized asset for much longer.

#  Neymar reveals he is a big fan of baccarat, but will he still be a PSG player after this season?

Neymar has long been associated with baccarat – the high stakes card game that is popular with celebrities and professional gamblers around the world. The Brazilian superstar has now revealed that he is a big fan of the game, and credits it with helping him to develop his own gambling strategies.

While Neymar may enjoy baccarat, it is unclear whether he will still be a PSG player after this season. Speculation continues to mount that the 27-year-old could leave the French club, with Real Madrid being mooted as a potential destination.

Regardless of where Neymar ends up playing next season, it seems safe to say that he will continue to enjoy baccarat – and maybe even pick up some new tips along the way!

#  Could casino games be the difference between winning and losing in Ligue1? 

While it is ultimately the players on the pitch that determine the outcome of a football match, there are other factors at play that can make all the difference. One such example could be how a team performs in casino games.

In Ligue1, for instance, AS Monaco’s poor form in casino games is thought to have contributed to their relegation from the top flight last season. Conversely, Paris Saint-Germain are often considered one of the favourites to win the competition and their strong performances in casino games have been a key part of their success.

So, just how important can casino games be?

One of the main reasons why casino games can be so important is because they offer teams an additional way to earn money. In Ligue1, for example, teams can earn up to €5m per season by taking part in casino games. This means that even if a team isn’t doing well in the league, they can still make money by performing well in casino games.

Another reason why casino games are so important is because they can help teams improve their financial stability. In Ligue1, for example, clubs often rely on money from TV rights and sponsorship deals to survive. However, these sources of income can be unreliable and casino games offer a way for teams to make money even when they aren’t playing well in the league.

Finally, casino games can also help teams attract new players. In Ligue1, for example, teams often use casino games as a way to attract new players from other leagues. This is because casino games offer players a chance to earn lots of money quickly and easily. As such, it’s no surprise that many players see playing in casino games as a lucrative opportunity.

#  Monaco ready to pounce on any mistakes by PSG in the casino - will they be crowned champions?

The Ligue 1 season is drawing to a close and it is looking increasingly likely that Monaco will be crowned champions. They are currently four points clear of second-placed PSG, and with just six games remaining, it would take a spectacular collapse for them to miss out on the title.

PSG do still have a chance of winning the league, but they will need to start winning some games if they are to make up the deficit. They face a tricky away game at Lyon this weekend, and then they have a home game against Monaco. If they can take four or five points from those two games, they will be right back in the hunt for the title.

However, Monaco are not going to make things easy for them. The team from the principality have been in excellent form all season long, and they will be determined to win their first league title since 2000. They have already beaten PSG twice this season, so they will be confident of doing so again.

There is no doubt that Monaco have been the best team in France this season, and it would be a fitting end to their campaign if they were able to win the league title. Leonardo Jardim has done an excellent job in charge of the team, and he will be hoping to lead them to even greater success in the future.
