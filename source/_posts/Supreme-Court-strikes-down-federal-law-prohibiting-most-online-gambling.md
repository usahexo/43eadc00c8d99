#  Supreme Court strikes down federal law prohibiting most online gambling

On Monday, the United States Supreme Court ruled in a landmark decision that the federal law prohibiting most online gambling is unconstitutional.

The 5-4 ruling found that the law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), interfered with states’ rights to regulate gambling within their borders. The Court also found that the law violated the Tenth Amendment, which reserves certain powers for the states.

“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito in the majority opinion. “Congress can regulate sports betting directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted with the majority, added in a concurring opinion that PASPA “violates the fundamental constitutional principle of equal sovereignty” among the states.

The decision opens up the possibility for states to legalize sports betting within their borders, though it remains to be seen how individual states will choose to proceed. Nevada has been the only state where sports betting has been legal since 1992, thanks to a grandfather clause in PASPA.

The National Football League and other major professional sports leagues had lobbied hard for PASPA’s passage in 1992, arguing that legalizing sports betting would hurt public confidence in their games. But Justice Alito noted in his opinion that “the evidence [in this case] does not support that conclusion.”

Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog said of Monday’s ruling: “This decision probably opens up a huge potential market and eliminates one of organized labor's last strongholds—a 'closed shop.' It will also produce significant revenue from taxes on wagers. The potential downside for society is increased addiction and associated social ills."

#  States can now decide whether to allow online gambling within their borders

On Thursday, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of a state’s right to allow or prohibit online gambling within its borders. This ruling overturns a previous federal law that prohibited states from legalizing online gambling.

The plaintiffs in this case were New Jersey and several other states who argued that the federal law was unconstitutional because it regulated what states could and couldn’t do, an area which is traditionally left to the states. The defendants in the case were the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority opinion, stating that “the pre-emption of state laws regulating gambling is not supported by either the text or history of the Interstate Horseracing Act (IHA) or the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).”

This ruling has potentially far-reaching implications for states who are looking to generate new revenue streams. It could also pave the way for other forms of online gambling such as poker and sports betting to be legalized at the state level.

#  Nevada sees surge in online gambling revenue after legalizing it last year

After legalizing online gambling in Nevada last year, the state has seen a surge in revenue from the industry. According to recently released figures from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, online gambling brought in $48 million in revenue for the state in 2015, a more than tenfold increase over the $4.5 million taken in during 2014. This makes Nevada the top online gambling market in the country, accounting for over two-thirds of all U.S. revenue from the activity.

The legalization of online gambling has been a boon to the casinos in Nevada, with several reporting significant increases in their gambling income. Caesars Entertainment, which operates nine casinos in Nevada, saw its total gambling revenue from those properties increase by 5 percent last year thanks largely to strong growth in online and mobile gaming. MGM Resorts also enjoyed a healthy boost from online gambling, with its revenue from that sector more than doubling last year.

Online gambling has been available in Nevada since before it was legalized, but it was operating in a legal gray area. In February 2013, then Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto issued an opinion stating that online poker was illegal under federal law, putting the future of the industry into doubt. However, the Justice Department’s subsequent decision to not prosecute licensed operators put things back on track and allowedNevada to move forward with legalization.

Other states have been watching Nevada’s success with online gambling and are considering similar measures. California is currently debating a bill that would legalize and regulate internet poker within its borders, while New Jersey is looking at expanding its current offerings to include other types of casino games such as slots and blackjack. If these measures are successful, it could mean even more money for state coffers from online gambling taxes and fees.

#  New Jersey casino sees $20 million in online gambling revenue in first month of operation

# Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey says its online casino saw a total of $20 million in revenue during its first month of operation. This number is said to be made up of about $11 million from desktop computer users and an additional $9 million from mobile device users.

Borgata representatives attribute the strong start to their well-rounded game selection that includes slots, table games, and poker. They also cite the convenience of being able to play from anywhere in New Jersey, as well as the ability to make deposits and withdrawals quickly and easily.

Atlantic City casinos have been struggling in recent years as neighboring states have opened up their own gambling options. In order to stay competitive, Borgata and other casinos in the city have launched their own online casinos.

New Jersey was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, passing legislation in 2013. The state has seen steady growth in the industry, with over $166 million wagered in March of this year alone.

#  Many online gamblers still unaware of legality of their activities

Despite the fact that online gambling is legal in many parts of the world, a large portion of online gamblers remain unaware of the legality of their activities. A recent study by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research found that 65 percent of online gamblers were unaware that their activities were legal in at least some jurisdictions.

The research also found that a majority of respondents (64 percent) mistakenly believed that online gambling was illegal in most or all jurisdictions. This lack of understanding about the legality of online gambling can have serious consequences, as it can lead to players making poor choices about where to gamble and exposing themselves to greater risks.

The perception that online gambling is illegal in most jurisdictions is likely due to the fact that many countries do not have specific laws regulating online gambling. This has led to a patchwork of regulation around the world, with some countries having very restrictive laws and others having no laws regulating the activity at all.

This inconsistency can be confusing for players, who may not know whether they are breaking the law by gambling online. The situation is made even more complicated by the fact that some countries have both restrictive and liberal laws governing online gambling. For example, while Spain has a very restrictive law regulating online gambling, Denmark has no specific laws governing the activity.

This confusion can lead to problems for players who engage in online gambling without knowing whether it is legal or not. In some cases, players may be subject to fines or even jail time if they are caught gambling illegally. In other cases, players may simply be asked to stop playing or face prosecution.

Players who are unsure about the legality of their activities should seek legal advice before engaging in any form of online gambling. By doing so, they can ensure that they are complying with the law and avoid any potential problems with authorities.
