#  What are the game rules for Wild Hearts?

The game of Wild Hearts is designed for 3 to 6 players and takes around 30 minutes to play. The aim of the game is to score points by racing your horses around the board and taking advantage of bonuses.

To set up, each player chooses a color and is given a set of 4 horse pawns in that color, as well as a set of 12 cards. The cards are numbered 1-12, with the numbers in each suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) ascending from low to high. The player also receives a starting hand of 3 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table to form a draw pile.

The player with the lowest card starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player's turn they must do one of three things:

1) Play one card from their hand and move one of their horses accordingly
2) Pick up one card from either the draw pile or any other player's discard pile and add it to their hand
3) Replace one or more cards in their hand with new cards from the draw pile


When playing a card, the number on the card specifies how many spaces the horse on which it is played can move. If there are no obstacles between the current space and where the horse is moving to, then it may move as many spaces as shown on the card. However, if there are any obstacles (e.g., other players' horses), then movement is restricted accordingly. Special bonus cards also exist which provide various benefits such as extra moves or immunity from being captured by other players.

The first player to reach the finish space wins!
