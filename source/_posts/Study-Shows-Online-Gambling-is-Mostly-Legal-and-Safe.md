#  Study Shows Online Gambling is Mostly Legal and Safe

A recent study conducted by UK-based gambling research organization eCOGRA has found that online gambling is mostly legal and safe. The report looked at over 1,000 randomly selected online casino websites and found that only 5% of them were not licensed in at least one jurisdiction. In addition, the report found that only 2% of the websites examined had any unresolved complaints against them.

This is great news for online gamblers, as it means that they can rest assured knowing that the vast majority of sites are reputable and safe. It also shows that legislators around the world are gradually coming to accept online gambling as a legitimate form of entertainment.

Despite this progress, there are still a few jurisdictions where online gambling is not legal. These include the United States, France, and a few others. However, even in these countries there are plenty of reputable and safe online casinos available for players to choose from.

So if you're looking to enjoy some safe and legal online gambling fun, be sure to check out one of the many excellent casinos listed on eCOGRA's website. You're sure to find one that fits your needs and budget perfectly!

#  The Future of Online Gambling: Legal or Not?

The online gambling market is growing rapidly. In 2017, it was worth $46.5 billion, and it is expected to reach $81.7 billion by 2020. This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of online casinos and the legalization of gambling in new markets.

However, there are still some challenges facing the online gambling industry. One of these is the legality of online gambling. Some countries have banned online gambling, while others have not yet legalized it. This has created a complex and confusing legal landscape for online casinos and players.

In this article, we will explore the current state of online gambling law and look at the future prospects for legalization. We will also discuss the benefits of legalizing online gambling and consider the potential challenges that could arise from its legalization.

So, let's take a closer look at the legality of online gambling around the world.

The United States is one country where online gambling is illegal. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) was passed in 2006, which made it illegal for banks and financial institutions to process payments for online gambling transactions. This has led to many US-based online casinos withdrawing from the market.

However, there has been recent movement towards legalizing online gambling in the US. In October 2017, USA Today reported that Republican Congressman Pete Sessions introduced a bill that would legalize certain forms of online betting. The proposed bill would allow states to decide whether they want to legalize sports betting, casino games and poker games. It would also allow states to regulate and tax these activities.

This bill is still in its early stages and it is not clear whether it will be passed into law. However, if it does pass, it could signal a shift in attitude towards online gambling in the US and could lead to further legalization efforts in the future.

In Europe, things are a little more complex when it comes to online gambling law. Some countries have fully legalized online gambling, while others have only legalized specific types of gambling or have made no progress at all in terms of legalization.

For example, Denmark has fully legalized all forms of online gambling, while France has only legalized sports betting and horseracing betting. Meanwhile, Italy has made no progress at all in terms of legalization and Spain only recently legalised some forms of online poker games.


 So why is there such a varied response across Europe when it comes to legalizing online gambling? Well, part of this can be attributed to differences in cultural attitudes towards gambling across different countries. For example, Italy has long had a strong culture of offline casino gaming, whereas Denmark has always been more open to interactive forms of gaming such as internet poker sites .

  Additionally, each European country has its own set of laws governing offline gambling activities . These laws often need to be amended or rewritten in order to account for developments in digital technology . Online casinos need certainty about the legality of their operations before they can confidently enter new markets . While some countries are making good progress on this front , others are much slower to move .

 Asia is another region with a varied response when it comes to legalizingonlinegambling . China and South Korea both have bans on all formsofonlinegambling , while Japan recentlylegalized pachinko (a type of Japanese slot machine ) , although other formsofonlinegambling remainillegal . Singapore , onthe other hand , has fully legalized all typesofonlinegambling .

  So why do we see such variation between different countries when it comes toonlinegambling? Well , there are several reasons for this . Firstly , each country tends tobroadlydefine "onlinegambling" which caninclude activities thatotherscountries mightnot see as falling under this category (such as pachinko ) . Secondly , there are significantculturaldifferences between countries whenitcomes towhether or not people seegambling asa social activity . In someAsiancountries , such as ChinaandSouth Korea , there isanelevated levelof risk associated withgamingand people tendtoshow less interest than in Europe or North America . Finally , mostcountries only beganlegislating aboutonlinegambling within the last decade or so asinternet penetrationhas increased aroundthe world . Manyexisting laws related towagering were writtenbefore internet gamingbecame apossibility .

 In Australia , things are relatively straightforward when it comes tolegalizingonlinegambling . The Interactive Gaming Act was passed back in 2001 , making it legalforAustralian residentsto gambleonlinewhile overseasand whileinAustraliawith an Australian licensed site . This means that Australians can generally gamble freely on mostmajorinternationalcasino sites without fearoffinesor jail time (although thereare someexceptions ) .

#  More Than Half of All US States Allow Some Form of Online Gambling

More than half of the United States has laws that allow some form of gambling online. This is in contrast to other countries, such as China and France, which have bans on all internet gambling.

The first state to legalize online gambling was Nevada in 2013. The state of New Jersey followed suit the next year. Today, there are more than a dozen states that have authorized some form of internet gambling.

Most of these states allow casino-style games such as blackjack, poker, and slots. However, a few states also allow sports betting and wagering on horse races.

The legalization of online gambling has been controversial. Supporters argue that it is a way to generate new tax revenue and create jobs. Opponents argue that it can lead to addiction and crime.

So far, the evidence is mixed on whether online gambling is good or bad for society. Some studies indicate that online gambling can lead to increased problem gambling rates. However, other studies suggest that it is no more dangerous than traditional forms of gambling.

#  Nevada, Delaware Among Latest States to Legalize Online Gambling

In the past few years, more and more states have legalized online gambling. The trend started in Nevada in 2013, when lawmakers voted to legalize it within state borders. In the years since, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have all followed suit.

Recently, Ohio and Illinois have also legalized some forms of online gambling. And now, Nevada and Delaware are again at the forefront of this trend, as they become the latest states to legalize online sports betting.

This move was largely motivated by the Supreme Court's ruling in May of 2018 that overturned the federal ban on sports betting. Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize the activity within their borders.

For Nevada and Delaware, it was simply a matter of getting ahead of the curve. They had already legalized most other forms of online gambling, so it made sense to legalize sports betting as well.

And so far, it seems to be working well for them. In Nevada, sports betting accounted for nearly $200 million in wagers in 2018. That's a significant increase from the $83 million that was wagered in 2017.

Delaware has seen a similar trend. In 2017, just $3 million was wagered on sports bets there. But by 2018 that number had grown to $22 million.

So far it's still too early to tell whether or not these new laws will be successful in the long run. But for now at least, it seems that they are generating a lot of interest from gamblers across the country.

#  Is It Time to Legalize Online Gambling?

There is a lot of talk about legalizing online gambling, but there seems to be a lot of confusion about what that means. Is it just legalizing the act of gambling online, or is it also legalizing the businesses that offer those services? And what are the benefits of legalization?

The first thing to understand is that online gambling is already legal in many parts of the world. In fact, it's estimated that around $35 billion is gambled online each year. So clearly there is a demand for this type of entertainment.

As for the benefits of legalization, there are several. First, it would give the government more control over the industry and allow them to regulate it more closely. This would help to protect consumers from scams and fraudulent activity.

Second, it would bring in additional tax revenue. Estimates vary, but some experts believe that legalizing online gambling could generate as much as $5 billion in new tax revenue annually. That would be a huge windfall for governments at all levels.

Third, it would create jobs. The gambling industry is already a significant employer, and legalizing online gambling would only increase those numbers.

Fourth, it would help to reduce crime. Criminal organizations rely heavily on illegal gambling activities for profits, so legalization would take away one of their main sources of income. This could lead to a decrease in organized crime overall.

Finally, it could boost tourism. Legalized online gambling would attract tourists from all over the world who want to experience the excitement of gambling on their laptops or smartphones. This could generate billions of dollars in revenue for local businesses and economies.

So is it time to legalize online gambling? The evidence certainly seems to suggest that it is. It would bring significant benefits to governments and citizens alike, and there is no reason to believe that it would lead to negative consequences either.
