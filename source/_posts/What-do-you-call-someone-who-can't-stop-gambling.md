Problem gambling, or pathological gambling, is a type of addiction where you can't resist betting or gambling, even if it harms your relationships, job, or health. Problem gamblers make up less than 1% of the population but account for nearly half of all gambling losses.

There are three main types of problem gambling: social (or recreational) gambling, which is occasional betting with friends; casual gambling, where people bet small amounts and don't have a strong desire to continue; and disordered gambling, which is when someone has symptoms of addiction and cannot control their behavior.

problem gamblers may feel an intense need to gamble more money, take bigger risks, and gamble for longer periods of time. They also often experience negative consequences as a result of their addiction, such as feeling stressed or overwhelmed, strained relationships with friends and family, financial difficulties, and even criminal activity.
