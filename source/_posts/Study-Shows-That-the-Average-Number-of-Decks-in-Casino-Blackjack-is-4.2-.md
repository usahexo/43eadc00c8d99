#  Study Shows That the Average Number of Decks in Casino Blackjack is 4.2 
The study, which was carried out by two professors at the University of Nevada, Reno, looked at over 2 million hands of blackjack dealt at casinos in the United States.
The research found that the average number of decks played in blackjack is 4.2, with 89% of all hands dealt being with four or fewer decks.
There was also a significant difference in the average number of hands played as the bet size increased. For example, while the average number of decks played with a $5 bet was 4.1, this increased to 4.5 when the bet size increased to $100.
Commenting on the findings, one of the professors, Anthony Lucas, said "Our findings are contrary to previous beliefs that high roller tables use more decks."
He added that "the use of more decks does not seem to provide an advantage to either the casino or player."
While blackjack is often seen as a game that favours the house, Lucas said that "using fewer decks gives players a better chance to win".
The study's other author, Edwin Crawford, said that it "shows just how important it is for players to find casinos that use few decks if they want to improve their chances of winning".


#  Nevada Casinos Stick to the Traditional 6 Decks for Blackjack Games 

There are a lot of choices that go into playing blackjack, from the number of decks in the game to when you should hit or stand. Nevada casinos have been slow to adopt some of the newer variations of the game, sticking instead to the traditional 6-deck games.

Why is this? There are a few explanations. First, there is a fair amount of risk in introducing new games – if players don’t like them, they may not come back. Second, some of the new variations can be confusing for players. Finally, casinos make more money from 6-deck games because they have an edge over players.

That said, there are a few casinos in Nevada that are starting to experiment with different blackjack games. The MGM Grand in Las Vegas, for example, offers both 4- and 8-deck games with different rules. The Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas also has a few different blackjack games on offer.

If you want to try out some of the newer blackjack variations, your best bet is to head to one of these casinos. If you’re looking for a more traditional experience, stick to the 6-deck games at most casinos in Nevada.

#  More and More Casinos are Adopting 8-Deck Games of Blackjack 

As a player of blackjack, you may have noticed that more and more casinos are using 8-deck games. The reason for this is simple – it benefits the casino more than the player.

The typical blackjack game uses between 4 and 6 decks of cards. With 8 decks, the house edge increases from 0.5% to 0.6%. This may not seem like much, but when you’re playing dozens or even hundreds of hands per hour, those small edges can add up quickly.

There are a few ways to deal with the increased house edge. One is to increase your betting spread. If you’re normally betting $5 per hand, for example, try increasing it to $10 or even $15 per hand. This will help you stay in the game longer and give you a better chance of winning in the long run.

Another option is to use basic strategy less strictly. If you always stand on 17 but the casino has an 8-deck game, you may want to consider hitting on 17 if the dealer is showing a low card (2 through 6). This will give you a better chance of winning while still keeping most of your basic strategy intact.

Whatever approach you take, be sure to do your research first. There are many online resources that can help you learn about 8-deck blackjack games and how to beat them. With a little bit of effort, you can turn what used to be an unfavorable situation into a profitable one.

#  Why Do Some Casinos Use More than 8 Decks of Cards for Blackjack? 

Casinos use more than 8 decks of cards for blackjack because it gives them an advantage over players. With more decks in play, the casino has a higher chance of getting the desired cards to form winning hands. This also increases the house edge, making it harder for players to win.

#  Is the Use of More Than 8 Decks in Casino Blackjack a Good Idea?

There is no definitive answer to this question. Some gamblers believe that using more than 8 decks in casino blackjack gives the player an edge, while others think that it decreases their chances of winning. Let’s take a closer look at both sides of this argument.

When playing blackjack with fewer decks, there are more high cards remaining in the deck, which gives the player a better chance of drawing one of these cards. This is why many people believe that using more than 8 decks in casino blackjack decreases the player’s odds of winning.

However, others believe that using more decks actually gives the player an edge. With more decks in play, the house has a smaller percentage of each deck to win with. This means that players have a better chance of getting a good hand and beating the dealer.

So, what is the best strategy? Ultimately, it depends on your own playing style and preferences. If you feel confident using more than 8 decks in casino blackjack, then go for it! However, if you are uncomfortable with this number, stick to 8 or fewer decks. Whichever strategy you choose, be sure to practice diligently and always gamble responsibly.
