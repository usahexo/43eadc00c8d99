        <h1 id="What-is-the-game-art"><a href="#What-is-the-game-art" class="headerlink" title="What is the game art?"></a>What is the game art?</h1><p>To many people, the answer to this question is obvious. However, when you start to scratch beneath the surface, things get a bit more complicated. In order to understand what game art is, we must first define what games are.</p>
<p>Games have been around for centuries and can be defined as “a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one in which players attempt to win points or prizes”. But what about video games? What is the difference between traditional games and video games? The following excerpt from an article by Gamespot attempts to provide an answer:</p>
<p>“Video games are digital, interactive experiences that blur the line between reality and fantasy. They can take place in any number of virtual realities–outer space, ancient civilizations, post-apocalyptic worlds, etc.–or in simulated versions of our own world. Video games allow players to do things they couldn’t do in real life and experience emotions they wouldn’t normally feel. They can be anything from light-hearted fun to deeply immersive stories with complex characters”</p>
<p>Based on this definition, it seems that game art refers to all the various elements that come together to create a video game- from the environment and character designs, to the music and sound effects. It is a combination of all these elements that create the unique experience that is a video game.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of game art is its ability to immerse players into the game world. This has been achieved through the use of various techniques such as 3D graphics, motion capture, and procedural animation. As video games continue to evolve, we can expect to see even more stunning visuals and immersive gameplay experiences.</p>
<p>The importance of game art was recently demonstrated by Nintendo with their release of Mario Odyssey. This title was praised for its amazing graphics and immersive gameplay mechanics. According to IGN’s assessment:</p>
<p>“Odyssey is overflowing with stuff to find while looking around its absolutely gorgeous levels—filled with intricate details like fountains spraying water droplets into the air on a sun-drenched plaza stage shown in our demo or punchable clouds that rain coins down on you while playing as Cappy in bonus areas themed after Super Mario Sunshine’s Gelato Beach stage”<br>Praise for Mario Odyssey isn’t limited to just its graphics however. The gameplay mechanics have also been praised for their creativity and innovation:</p>
<p>“Odyssey also overhauls movement controls comprehensively; jumping feels largely familiar but almost every other action is brand new….Mario now has full 360-degree control over his movement while sprinting (and even while hanging off an edge), letting you pull off some impressive stunts right out the gate. You can also equip temporary powers called ‘Cappy movesets’ which range from cool (like gliding as long as you hold down jump) to extremely essential (like being able to swim underwater). Combine this newfound freedom with Odyssey‘s many secrets (including optional 8-bit challenges), secret exits for nearly every level, and new friends waiting around every corner and there’s seemingly no endearing this adventure – even if it overstays its welcome just a smidgeon past 15 hours or so (excluding abundant postgame content) . “</p>
